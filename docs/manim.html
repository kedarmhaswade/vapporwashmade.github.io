<h1 id="manim-animations">Manim Animations</h1>
<p class="manim">Manim is a Python library which helps create mathematics animations. It can help visualize mathematics in ways that make it easier and more fun to learn.
It was originally created by 3Blue1Brown (3B1B) to help in his YouTube videos on mathematics, but is now maintained by the community.
By the way, it is an amazing channel. I recommend checking it out - you might learn something new about mathematics, maybe something you missed, or you might find an entirely different perspective on a topic you know.</p>
<p class="manim">Manim animations must be programmed entirely in Python (as it is a Python library). While learning to make animations, I had to constantly refer to the documentation, practicing by making simpler animations. Although I believe Manim has a learning curve, I think it is extremely powerful and useful.</p>

        Visualizing Derivatives Geometrically
    </div>
    <div class="video-desc">
        This animation shows how a derivative, which is usually derived algebraically using limits, can be shown geometrically. I believe geometry brings out the beauty in calculus and presents a new perspective.
