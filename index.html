            Hi, I'm Apoorv. I am a homeschooled 12th grader and a pursuer of various interests. I love the natural
            sciences, mathematics, and logic. But what I love the most is programming. Whenever I get a new programming problem 
            to solve, my eyes light up and I start solving the problem immediately. I am also having lots of fun learning computer science 
            theory.
            <br><br>I also love to do gymnastics (high bar and still rings are my favorite events). I have been doing gymnastics since I was 
            7, and started competitive gymnastics at 14.

        <div class="about-text">
            This website is programmed from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I decided to use HTML and CSS
            rather than a website making site such as Google Sites to help refresh my web development knowledge in case I choose
            to do such a project in the future. This website didn't require much web development skills. Whatever frontend skills I learned when I
            first learned JavaScript (and got interested in web development) sufficed.

            My Programming Journey
        </div>
        <div class="about-text">
            When I was in 4th grade (9 years old), I was first introduced to programming by my father. I began learning JavaScript, coding small visual 
            games such as hangman and tic-tac-toe. I eventually went on to making Node.js programs and learning a bit of Python. I loved the idea of 
            recursion, and I created many recursive programs.<br>
            In 9th grade, I took AP CS, 
            and so I had to learn Java (I knew the concepts but needed to learn Java syntax).<br>
            In 10th grade, I went deeper into recursion using the book "Thinking Recursively" by Eric Roberts. I got to explore a long-held interest of mine 
            and I understood various aspects of it I had overlooked or just not learned.<br>
            In 11th grade, I discovered competitive programming, and decided to go further into it. I began learning computer science theory.<br>
            In 12th grade, I decided to go further into computer science by taking the courses: MIT's "Mathematics for CS", MIT's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", and a course on Competitive Programming.

            What I have Learned In CS

            I have learned Java, JavaScript, and Python. I have also learned a little bit of web development, along with some JS frameworks (React, Angular). 
            I am currently learning computer science theory from two courses, Competitive Programming and Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP).
